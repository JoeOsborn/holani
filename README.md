# Holani
A cycle-stepped Atari Lynx emulator. 

The 65C02S cycle-stepped emulation is initially based on the excellent idea and design of [chips](https://github.com/floooh/chips)'s 6502.

## Holani is a library
You can use:
* [holani-retro](https://github.com/LLeny/holani-retro), a libretro implementation to play official games and homebrews. 
* [holani-min](https://github.com/LLeny/holani-min), a minimalistic self contained frontend.
* [holani-debug](https://github.com/LLeny/holani-debug), an Atari Lynx debugger built around holani.
